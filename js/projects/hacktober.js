  intro:
    "This year I participated in Hacktoberfest for the first time ever. I have to admit, I had no idea what it was before participating. All I had heard from some peers in a frontend dev discord Iâ€™m a part of, is that itâ€™s about encouraging everyone to get involved in open source. The kind folks at Stepzen had started a few repositories for anyone to get involved in, especially newbies like myself. I reached out to them on Github and they assigned me to a few issues that I felt comfortable tackling.",
  goals:
    "I have spent most of my programming career thus far freelancing, so I havenâ€™t had the opportunity to work on code with others. I feel that this is a skill that I need to develop and hacktoberfest was the kind of opportunity Iâ€™ve been looking for. By participating, I wanted to work on my communication skills, learn the git workflow, learn about contributing to open source and meet new people.",
  spotlight:
    "I had the opportunity to speak on a livestream on Stepzenâ€™s Youtube page. I got to discuss with and give feedback to the maintainers of the repositories. I also got to meet some of the other contributors and hear about how they approached their issues.",

  learned:
    "Hacktoberfest was such a great learning experience for me. The maintainers of the project had helpful advice and feedback whenever I felt uncertain about what I was doing and what direction to follow. I learnt a lot from the other contributorsâ€™ pull requests too. Everyone brought their experience to the project and approached issues in ways I wouldnâ€™t have thought to.",
